README

If you are doing this project from scratch, here are the products and files you can download to get your device to run just like ours

# Magic Mirror

First you will need a Rasperry Pi 3 and to connect that to a monitor. Then you can download all the files to your pi and it should be able to run.



# IMU Wristband

For the wristband, you will need a Raspberry Pi Zero, Berry IMU accelerometor/gyroscope, and battery source.

Download only the folder labeled 'imuWristbandPi' onto your raspberry pi zero. In that folder there is a file labeled 'imuPublisher.py'. Run that file with python 3 while the mirror is on, and you should be able to swile up to turn off the mirror, and swipe down to turn it back on.

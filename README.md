Voice recognition and spotify controls were done by Xuan-Huong Nguyen. All instructions for how to get started and run the program can be found 
in the voice_rec folder. 

We used PicoVoice's Rhino Voice Engine in order to generate an accurate speech intention program
Raspotify was used to make the raspberry pi a spotify connect device for streaming music through spotify
Spotipy API was used to generate a basic interface to control some aspects of spotify

BerryIMU was done by Sarah Redden. Testing the guroscope code and documentation is in the berryIMU folder. The final code for turning the screen on and off is the BerryNew.py file. This can be run with the supplicant files in the git that say "BerryIMU screen recognizer" next to the title. It can be run by itself(with supplecant filrs) or throuh the voice rec using the password "espresso".

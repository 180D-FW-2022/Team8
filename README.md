# Team8

Voice recognition and spotify controls were done by Xuan-Huong Nguyen. All instructions for how to get started and run the program can be found 
in the voice_rec folder. 

We used PicoVoice's Rhino Voice Engine in order to generate an accurate speech intention program
Raspotify was used to make the raspberry pi a spotify connect device for streaming music through spotify
Spotipy API was used to generate a basic interface to control some aspects of spotify

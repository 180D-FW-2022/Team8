# MMM-VoiceControl
This module was developed my Xuan-Huong Nguyen. In order to use this module, please make sure to download pvrhino & pvporcupine as described in the README in our home page.  

Pico Voice's Rhino Engine uses natural language detection in order to create a more streamlined interface between the users and the mirror. Commands can be asked in a variety of different ways in order to extract their intention. Pico Voice's Porcupine Engine is a lightweight engine that constantly listens for a specific word. In order to reduce the computation required for the pi, users must say "Hey there" before any command to start the Rhino Engine's voice recognition.  

Here are a list of things you can ask the mirror to do:  

"Hey there, "  

stop, start, skip/next, play, pause, previous, and add a new user  

Can all be asked using voice control capabilities. Users have full control over their spotify account using these commands.
